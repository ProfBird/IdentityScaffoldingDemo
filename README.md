# Identity Scaffolding Demo
This ASP.NET 8.0 MVC web site was created in Visual Studio 2022.
The following steps were taken to create a base web site.

1. Created a new project with identity included.
2. Added a model named AppUser that inherits from IdentityUser.
3. Added scaffolding for some of the identity Pages.
4. Added seed data for an admin user.
5. Changed the database to MySQL.

Here's a link to a screen-cast showing the whole process:
